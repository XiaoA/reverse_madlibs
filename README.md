reverse_madlibs
===============

A couple fun reverse madlib stories, written in Ruby, as part of the first course at http://gotealeaf.com

There are two sets of madlibs:
1. The Legend of Tealeaf
2. A Chinese Story

I'd like to thank [Iggy Krajci](https://github.com/hathcox/Madlibs) for the word lists.
