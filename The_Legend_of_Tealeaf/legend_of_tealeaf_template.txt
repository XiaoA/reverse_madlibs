NAME wanted to learn to code, so NOMINATIVE_PRONOUN decided to sign up at Tealeaf Academy. But halfway through the first course, a NOUN came to OBJECTIVE_PRONOUN in a dream, and said, "You should not bother with Ruby. Instead, why don't you learn about NOUNs?"

So NAME decided to travel to a faraway mountain, where a great master was said to live. NAME knew NOMINATIVE_PRONOUN woud have to pack lightly, but NOMINATIVE_PRONOUN couldn't bear the thought of not taking POSSESSIVE_PRONOUN NOUN, NOUN, or POSSESSIVE_PRONOUN trusty NOUN. So NAME packed them up, and said goodbye to POSSESSIVE_PRONOUN family and friends, and started off on POSSESSIVE_PRONOUN journey.

Along the way, NOMINATIVE_PRONOUN met a tiny elf with a ADJECTIVE NOUN. The elf agreed to show OBJECTIVE_PRONOUN the way. After a few days, it was obvious that they were lost. The elf gave NAME a ADJECTIVE look, and said, "The truth is, I am a lost soul. I once had a bright future in web development, but I decided to quit studying at Tealeaf, so I could take some courses at another online school. At the end, I was broke, and I hadn't learned enough. So now, I am desitined to walk the earth alone, in search of magical NOUNs, which I can sell for the money to buy a computer, a NOUN, and the tuition for the Tealeaf courses. But an evil witch told me that I will never find these things, because I'm ADJECTIVE. I'd suggest that you go home and keep studying at Tealeaf!"

NAME woke up with with a start. It had all been a nightmare! NOMINATIVE_PRONOUN looked at the program on POSSESSIVE_PRONOUN computer, and laughed. It was time to write a method. Life was good again.

NAME went on to become a famous web developer, famous through the land for being both wise and writing code that was so readable, it was almost poetic. NAME lived happily ever after, with a NOUN and a NOUN to keep NAME company.
